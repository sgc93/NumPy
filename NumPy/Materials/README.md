## NumPy

# What is NumPy?

- it is a python library that supports a multidimesional array and matrices, as well as function which can operate on these arrays and matrices.
- it stands for "Numirical Python"

# what it different from Python list?

- it is faster
- it allows single data type items with fixed number of items

# why it is faster?

- it uses contiguous memory ( it stores items in continuos place)
- it is fixed type, so no checking for Size
- it's items data type is same type, so nochecking for Object Type
- it uses vectorization (absence of any explicit looping, indexing, ...)
